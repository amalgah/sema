# Dashboard
The dashboard is the main area of interaction in Sema. By arranging widgets in the grid layout, you can view and interact with the information that matters most.

All widgets share a few common interactions denoted by the following icons:

    + – top-left corner, drags and positions the widget in a grid layout

    x – top-right corner, removes the widget from the dashboard

    ⨼ – bottom-right corner, resizes the widget

Go ahead and tweak the current layout to your preferences.
