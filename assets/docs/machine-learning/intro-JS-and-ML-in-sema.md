# Introduction to the JavaScript Editor and Machine Learning in Sema

The JavaScript Editor accesible through the playground allows you to write any javascript code you wish. We provide methods to interface with the live-code editor so that you can incorporate the full power of the language of the web in tandem with your live coding mini-language.

With this comes the ability to import fully fledged machine learning libraries such as tensorflow.js and LALOLib.
