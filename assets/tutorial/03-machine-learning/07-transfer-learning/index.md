# Transfer learning with Magenta models

A Music Variational Autoencoder is a machine learning model that has previously been trained on a lot of MIDI files, and has learned to generate melodies or ensembles. It represents each music sample as a vector of 256 features, and every different vector of 256 numbers sounds like a different piece of music.
