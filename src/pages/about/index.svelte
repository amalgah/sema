        Sema is a live coding environment for performing and composing music in realtime using simple live coding languages.
      </span>
      <span>
        It is also a playground for designing and training machine learning networks and creating your own languages.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sema is similar to other live coding environments and domain-specific languages for sound and music, such as SuperCollider, TidalCycles and Gibber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uniquely, Sema provides an integrated experience to machine learning and language design in your Web browser. It has a real-time, interactive interpreter for machine learning libraries (e.g. <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js/">tensorflow.js</a> and a compiler for <a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/earley.html">BNF grammars</a>.
